            <h3>ABOUT</h3>


              My name is Kevinn Gonzales and I am based in the Los Angeles area.
              I have always been passionate about computers and technology and I
              decided that a career in this space is something I can see myself
              doing long-term. I started my journey in the tech space during the
              summer of 2023 through The Knowledge House Fellowship. Although, I
              am fairly new to this space, I am absolutely thrilled and excited
              to commit myself and focus these skills into a career where I'm
              excited to make a meaningful impact in the digital world.

              <h3>MISSION</h3>

              Having a good amount of experience in the customer-service space,
              I believe that I have exceptional interpersonal skills and
              customer satisfaction is a top priority for me. Additionally, with
              a keen eye for design and detail, I strive to create uniqe
              applications/websites that embody the vision and values for
              clients and companies.
